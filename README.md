This is our Activity Finder App!
It can be hard to find cool stuff to do when moving to a new city, especially as a college freshman. Which is why Activity Finder can be of good use! Looking for a place to eat some chicken wings? Search it up in the Activity Finder App and we will give you some of the best places that have wings around LA! Are you into drawing? Or art? Search those up top, and we will show you museums, and art studios. Any activity you can think of, Activity Finder will generate results!
