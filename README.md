Welcome to Activity Finder!

We created this app to help students discover new activities, events & venues to go to! As college students, we know it can be difficult to find new activities to do, especially if you're from a new city. With Activity Finder, we hope to help college students search for new activities in the LA area. Whether it's finding a new hobby, visiting a favorite restaurant, or quelling weekend boredom, our ultimate goal is to help college students create fun memories for years to come. 

To create Activity Finder, we used a React app, which employed HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We also used Yelp Fusion API (see the link below for information) and Replit, which upon input from the search bar, allowed us to display the activity's name, picture, address, phone number, and rating without showing the Yelp Fusion API key. We also used Firebase, which allows users to login with their Google accounts to gain access to Activity Finder, and Firestore, which stores favorited activities (to add a favorite, press the heart button).

Looking for a place to eat some chicken wings? Search it up in the Activity Finder App and we will give you some of the best places that have wings around LA! Are you into drawing? Or art? Search those up top, and we will show you museums, and art studios. Any activity you can think of, Activity Finder will generate results!

Thank you for using Activity Finder!
